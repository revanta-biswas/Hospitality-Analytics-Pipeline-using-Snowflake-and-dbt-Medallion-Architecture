# Workflow Planning

**Purpose**: Determine which phases to execute and create comprehensive execution plan

**Always Execute**: This phase always runs after understanding requirements and scope

## Step 1: Load All Prior Context

### 1.1 Load Reverse Engineering Artifacts (if brownfield)
- atlas-deep-dive.md
- component-inventory.md
- technology-stack.md
- dependencies.md

### 1.2 Load Requirements Analysis
- requirements.md (includes intent analysis)
- requirement-verification-questions.md (with answers)

### 1.3 Load User Stories
- stories.md
- personas.md

### 1.4 Load Context Project Artifacts (if the user opted in)
- Read `## Context Project` in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`. **IF `Use Artifacts: Yes`**, load **only** the exact `Artifact Path` recorded there (no auto-scan of the rest of `spec/context-project/existing-knowledge/`) — it describes how the current system works, so use it as background context when planning. **IF `No`** or absent, skip.

### 1.5 Load Context References (if the user opted in)
- Read `## Context References` in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`. **IF `Use References: Yes`**, load **all** paths listed in `Reference Paths` — these are reference materials for the NEW work (UX wireframes, design mockups, API specs, research docs, etc.). Use them as forward-looking inputs when planning which stages to execute and at what depth. For example: a UI wireframe implies Application Design and Functional Design should run; an API spec implies NFR Requirements should assess performance. **IF `No`** or absent, skip.

## Step 2: Detailed Scope and Impact Analysis

**Now that we have complete context (requirements + stories), perform detailed analysis:**

### 2.1 Transformation Scope Detection (Brownfield Only)

**IF brownfield project**, analyze transformation scope:

#### Architectural Transformation
- **Single component change** vs **architectural transformation**
- **Infrastructure changes** vs **application changes**
- **Deployment model changes** (Lambda→Container, EC2→Serverless, etc.)

#### Related Component Identification
For transformations, identify:
- **Infrastructure code** that needs updates
- **CDK stacks** requiring changes
- **API Gateway** configurations
- **Load balancer** requirements
- **Networking** changes needed
- **Monitoring/logging** adaptations

#### Cross-Package Impact
- **CDK infrastructure** packages requiring updates
- **Shared models** needing version updates
- **Client libraries** requiring endpoint changes
- **Test packages** needing new test scenarios

### 2.2 Change Impact Assessment

#### Impact Areas
1. **User-facing changes**: Does this affect user experience?
2. **Structural changes**: Does this change system architecture?
3. **Data model changes**: Does this affect database schemas or data structures?
4. **API changes**: Does this affect interfaces or contracts?
5. **NFR impact**: Does this affect performance, security, or scalability?

#### Application Layer Impact (if applicable)
- **Code changes**: New entry points, adapters, configurations
- **Dependencies**: New libraries, framework changes
- **Configuration**: Environment variables, config files
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests

#### Infrastructure Layer Impact (if applicable)
- **Deployment model**: Lambda→ECS, EC2→Fargate, etc.
- **Networking**: VPC, security groups, load balancers
- **Storage**: Persistent volumes, shared storage
- **Scaling**: Auto-scaling policies, capacity planning

#### Operations Layer Impact (if applicable)
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, custom metrics, dashboards
- **Logging**: Log aggregation, structured logging
- **Alerting**: Alarm configurations, notification channels
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipeline changes, rollback strategies

### 2.3 Component Relationship Mapping (Brownfield Only)

**IF brownfield project**, create component dependency graph:

```markdown
## Component Relationships
- **Primary Component**: [Package being changed]
- **Infrastructure Components**: [CDK/Terraform packages]
- **Shared Components**: [Models, utilities, clients]
- **Dependent Components**: [Services that call this component]
- **Supporting Components**: [Monitoring, logging, deployment]
```

For each related component:
- **Change Type**: Major, Minor, Configuration-only
- **Change Reason**: Direct dependency, deployment model, networking
- **Change Priority**: Critical, Important, Optional

### 2.4 Risk Assessment

Evaluate risk level:
1. **Low**: Isolated change, easy rollback, well-understood
2. **Medium**: Multiple components, moderate rollback, some unknowns
3. **High**: System-wide impact, complex rollback, significant unknowns
4. **Critical**: Production-critical, difficult rollback, high uncertainty

## Step 3: Phase Determination

### 3.1 User Stories - Always Executed
User Stories always execute. Move to next determination.


### 3.2 Application Design - Execute IF:
- New components or services needed
- Component methods and business rules need definition
- Service layer design required
- Component dependencies need clarification

**Skip IF**:
- Changes within existing component boundaries
- No new components or methods
- Pure implementation changes

### 3.3 NFR Implementation - Execute IF:
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations
- Scalability concerns
- Monitoring/observability needed

**Skip IF**:
- Existing NFR setup sufficient
- No new NFR requirements
- Simple changes with no NFR impact

## Step 4: Note Adaptive Detail

**See [depth-levels.md](../common/depth-levels.md) for adaptive depth explanation**

For each stage that will execute:
- All defined artifacts will be created
- Detail level within artifacts adapts to problem complexity
- Model determines appropriate detail based on problem characteristics

## Step 5: Multi-Module Coordination Analysis (Brownfield Only)

**IF brownfield with multiple modules/packages**, analyze dependencies and determine optimal update strategy:

### 5.1 Analyze Module Dependencies
- Examine build system dependencies and dependency manifests
- Identify build-time vs runtime dependencies
- Map API contracts and shared interfaces between modules

### 5.2 Determine Update Strategy
Based on dependency analysis, decide:
- **Update sequence**: Which modules must be updated first due to dependencies
- **Parallelization opportunities**: Which modules can be updated simultaneously
- **Coordination requirements**: Version compatibility, API contracts, deployment order
- **Testing strategy**: Per-module vs integrated testing approach
- **Rollback strategy**: Recovery plan if mid-sequence failures occur

### 5.3 Document Coordination Plan
```markdown
## Module Update Strategy
- **Update Approach**: [Sequential/Parallel/Hybrid]
- **Critical Path**: [Modules that block other updates]
- **Coordination Points**: [Shared APIs, infrastructure, data contracts]
- **Testing Checkpoints**: [When to validate integration]
```

Identify for each affected module:
- **Update priority**: Must-update-first vs can-update-later
- **Dependency constraints**: What it depends on, what depends on it
- **Change scope**: Major (breaking), Minor (compatible), Patch (fixes)

## Step 6: Generate Workflow Visualization

Create Mermaid flowchart showing:
- All phases in sequence
- EXECUTE or SKIP decision for each conditional phase
- Proper styling for each phase state

**Styling rules** (add after flowchart):
```
style WD fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#1B5E20,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
style CG fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#1B5E20,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
style BT fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#1B5E20,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff
style US fill:#BDBDBD,stroke:#424242,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5,color:#000
style Start fill:#CE93D8,stroke:#6A1B9A,stroke-width:3px,color:#000
style End fill:#CE93D8,stroke:#6A1B9A,stroke-width:3px,color:#000

linkStyle default stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Style Guidelines**:
- Completed/Always execute: `fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#1B5E20,stroke-width:3px,color:#fff` (Material Green with white text)
- Conditional EXECUTE: `fill:#FFA726,stroke:#E65100,stroke-width:3px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5,color:#000` (Material Orange with black text)
- Conditional SKIP: `fill:#BDBDBD,stroke:#424242,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5,color:#000` (Material Gray with black text)
- Start/End: `fill:#CE93D8,stroke:#6A1B9A,stroke-width:3px,color:#000` (Material Purple with black text)
- Phase containers: Use lighter Material colors (PLANNING: #BBDEFB, IMPLEMENTATION: #C8E6C9)

## Step 7: Create Execution Plan Document

Create `spec/plans/executions.md`:

```markdown
# Execution Plan

## Phases to Execute

### 🔵 PLANNING PHASE
- [x] Workspace Detection (COMPLETED)
- [x] Reverse Engineering (COMPLETED/SKIPPED)
- [x] Requirements Analysis (COMPLETED)
- [x] User Stories (COMPLETED)
- [x] Execution Plan (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Application Design - [EXECUTE/SKIP]

### 🧪 ve TRACK (parallel — ve-initiated, NOT planned or executed by this workflow)
- Test Plan — run per story by ve with **`/ve-implement`**, in parallel with development
- ve Sign-off — run by ve with **`ve-list-work`** on the epic branch once story PRs merge
  - **Rationale**: Test Plan is not a Implementation stage at epic or story level; it is not scheduled here and is never auto-run

## Package Change Sequence (Brownfield Only)
[If applicable, list package update sequence with dependencies]

## Estimated Timeline
- **Total Phases**: [Number]
- **Estimated Duration**: [Time estimate]

## Success Criteria

- **Key Deliverables**: [List]
- **Quality Gates**: [List]

[IF brownfield]
- **Integration Testing**: All components working together

```

## Step 8: Initialize State Tracking

Update `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`:

```markdown
# aire State Tracking

- [ ] Infrastructure Design - [EXECUTE/SKIP]
- [ ] Code Generation - EXECUTE

### 🧪 ve TRACK (parallel, ve-initiated — not scheduled here)
- Test Plan per story — `/ve-implement`
- ve Sign-off — `ve-list-work`

## Current Status
- **Lifecycle Phase**: PLANNING
- **Current Stage**: Workflow Planning Complete
- **Next Stage**: [Next stage to execute]
- **Status**: Ready to proceed
```

## Step 9: Present the Plan ( AUTOMATIC — announcement, NOT an approval gate)

> 🔴 **No approval is requested here and nothing blocks.** This plan only decides WHICH stages run;
> every stage it selects still runs its own rule file with its own gate, so the plan cannot commit
> the user to anything unreviewed. Present it, then **proceed straight to the next stage**.
> If the user volunteers a change ("also run Application Design", "skip NFR Design"), apply it and
> continue — that is an interrupt, not a gate.


```markdown
# Workflow Planning Complete

I've created a comprehensive execution plan based on:
- Your request: [Summary]
- Existing system: [Summary if brownfield]
- Requirements: [Summary if executed]
- User stories: [Summary]

**Detailed Analysis**:
- Risk level: [Level]
- Impact: [Summary of key impacts]
- Components affected: [List]

**Recommended Execution Plan**:

I recommend executing [X] stages:

🔵 **PLANNING PHASE:**
1. [Stage name] - *Rationale:* [Why executing]
2. [Stage name] - *Rationale:* [Why executing]
...

🟢 **IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:**
3. [Stage name] - *Rationale:* [Why executing]
4. [Stage name] - *Rationale:* [Why executing]
...

I recommend skipping [Y] stages:

🔵 **PLANNING PHASE:**
1. [Stage name] - *Rationale:* [Why skipping]
2. [Stage name] - *Rationale:* [Why skipping]
...

🟢 **IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:**
3. [Stage name] - *Rationale:* [Why skipping]
4. [Stage name] - *Rationale:* [Why skipping]
...

[IF brownfield with multiple packages]
**Recommended Package Update Sequence**:
1. [Package] - [Reason]
2. [Package] - [Reason]
...

**Estimated Timeline**: [Duration]

> ** <u>**FOR YOUR REVIEW:**</u>**  
> The execution plan is at: `spec/plans/executions.md`

> **➡ <u>**PROCEEDING AUTOMATICALLY**</u>** to **[Next Stage Name]** 
>
> Each stage listed above runs its own review/approval when it executes.
> Tell me any time if you want a stage added, removed, or re-scoped[ — including the stages
> currently marked SKIP] and I'll update the plan and continue.
```

## Step 10: Proceed Automatically

- **Default**: proceed immediately to the next stage in the execution plan — **do not wait for a
  response and do not ask "Ready to proceed?"**.
- **If the user volunteers changes** (now or later): update `executions.md` + the Stage Progress
  in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`, announce the revision, and continue from the revised plan.
- **If the user asks to force include/exclude a stage**: update the plan accordingly and continue.

## Step 11: Log Interaction

Log in `runtime-artifacts/audit.md`:

```markdown
## Workflow Planning - Plan Finalized (auto-approved, no gate)
**Timestamp**: [ISO timestamp]
**User Email**: [current session email — read live from the session context]
**AI Response**: "Execution plan created with [X] stages to execute, [Y] skipped; proceeded automatically to [Next Stage Name] without an approval gate."
**Status**: Auto-approved
**Context**: Workflow plan created with [X] stages to execute

---
```

If the user later volunteers a change to the plan, log that interaction separately with their
COMPLETE RAW input and the revision applied.
