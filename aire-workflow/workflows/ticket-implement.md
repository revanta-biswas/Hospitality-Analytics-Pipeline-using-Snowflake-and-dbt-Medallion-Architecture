# WORKFLOW: `ticket-implement <TICKET-ID>` (Unified Router — Bug OR Enhancement)

**Purpose**: ONE front door for working on an existing ticket in whichever tracker is configured (`## Tracker` → `Type`) — a Jira key, an ADO work item ID, a GitHub issue ref, or — for `Type: LOCAL` — no ID at all (the user describes the item inline instead). The router itself does NO development work — it captures the ticket, asks the user what it's about (bug fix vs enhancement), then hands off to the EXISTING workflow for that answer and follows it exactly:


The router NEVER duplicates, modifies, or shortcuts either target workflow. After routing, every rule of the chosen workflow applies as written.

## MANDATORY: Rule Details Loading

May be invoked standalone in a fresh session. Resolve `aire-workflow/` and load:
- `common/process-overview.md`, `common/session-continuity.md`, `common/question-format-guide.md`
- **`common/ci-setup-detection.md`** — detect existing AIRE-Helix CI infrastructure (Step 1.5 below)

Do NOT pre-load the bug or enhancement workflow files — load ONLY the one the user selects (saves context). Display the welcome message (`common/welcome-message.md`) once at start — the target workflow MUST NOT display it again.

All CLAUDE.md audit-logging rules apply: log EVERY user input verbatim in `runtime-artifacts/audit.md` (append-only, ISO 8601 timestamps, `**User Email**:` on every entry).

## Step 1 — Resume Check FIRST

If `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` exists, read it before anything else:
- If `## Tracker` records this SAME ticket with a `Workflow Type:` of `bug` or `enhancement`, **route immediately without asking** — the classification was already made. Route **stage-aware**:
  - `Workflow Type: bug`, analysis NOT yet complete → resume `workflows/bug-fix.md` from the recorded stage.
  - `Workflow Type: bug`, state records analysis/design complete (`awaiting bug-fix-implement`) but the fix not yet done — e.g. the session ended after analysis → announce ` Analysis already done for [TICKET-ID] — continuing with the fix implementation.`, read `workflows/bug-fix-implement.md`, and follow it exactly, as if the user had typed `bug-fix-implement`. (In an uninterrupted session this state is reached at `bug-fix` Step 9's ve Handoff Break — it persists only if the user answered `no` there.)
  - `Workflow Type: enhancement` → resume `workflows/enhancement-implement.md` from the recorded stage (its own yes/no implementation gate handles the analysis→implementation handoff — there is no second keyword in that flow).
  - Follow `common/session-continuity.md` for resume mechanics in all cases.
- If it records a DIFFERENT ticket/epic, ask the user which to keep — NEVER silently overwrite.
- If no state exists, continue to Step 2.

## Step 1.5 — CI Setup Detection (AUTOMATIC — runs once, recorded for downstream use)

**Execute this BEFORE routing**, whether resuming or starting fresh:

1. Load `common/ci-setup-detection.md` and execute the detection mechanism (check for the five mandatory CI artifacts).
2. Record the result in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` under `## CI Setup Status`, with the detected status (exists / missing), timestamp, and list of found/missing files.
3. Log the detection in `runtime-artifacts/audit.md` with the complete result.
4. **Do NOT announce or ask anything** — this is a silent, automatic check. The detection result is read and consumed by the downstream workflow (`bug-fix.md` / `enhancement-implement.md`) to decide whether to run full CI setup.

On **resume**, if `## CI Setup Status` already exists in `aire-state.md`, skip this step and reuse the recorded status.

## Step 2 — Ticket Capture

Dispatch on `## Tracker` → `Type`, per `common/tracker-sync.md` Section 8:
1. **JIRA/ADO/GITHUB**: parse the `<TICKET-ID>` from the invocation (key/ID/number or URL). If missing, ask for it and wait. Fetch the ticket (`getJiraIssue` / `az boards work-item show` / `gh issue view`): key, issue type, summary, description, acceptance criteria, labels.
2. **LOCAL**: no ID is expected in the invocation. Ask ` Describe the bug/enhancement (what's broken or what should change, and why):`, capture the answer, and mint a local ID (`BUG-LOCAL-N` / `ENH-LOCAL-N` — next unused N found by scanning `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md`) to use as `<TICKET-ID>` for the rest of this flow.
3. **MANDATORY**: Log the invocation (complete raw input) and the ticket fetch/capture in runtime-artifacts/audit.md.

## Step 3 — Ask What the Ticket Is About ( blocking question)

Present a short ticket summary, then ask with a **recommendation derived from the ticket** (issue type Bug, `bug`/`defect` labels, or defect-style wording → recommend A; issue type Story/Task describing new/changed behavior → recommend B). The recommendation is a suggestion only — **the user's answer decides**.

** GUARDRAIL — exactly TWO options, inline in the terminal, nothing else**:
- Print the question **inline in the chat/terminal** as plain markdown — NEVER via an interactive picker/menu tool, and NEVER in a question file.
- The options are **exactly `A` and `B` as shown below** — do NOT add a `C`, an "Other", "Both", "Skip", "Not sure", or any additional option. This deliberately OVERRIDES `common/question-format-guide.md`'s A–E/"Other" pattern: routing is binary.
- Do NOT reword, merge, or extend the two options; only the `[bracketed]` placeholders are substituted.
- Accept only `A` or `B` (case-insensitive) as the answer. Anything else (including "C" or "other") → re-ask the same two-option question, do not guess.

```markdown
 **[TICKET-ID]** — [summary]
Type: [issue type] | Labels: [labels]
[1–2 line description excerpt]

 What is this ticket about?

A)  Bug fix — something existing is broken and must be fixed
   (runs the bug workflow: bug-fix analysis, the ve handoff break, then the fix)
B)  Enhancement — extend or change the existing system's behavior
   (runs the enhancement workflow: analysis + implementation in one flow)

 Recommended: [A/B] — [one-line reason based on the ticket]

[Answer]:
```

**Block until the user answers.** Log the question and the verbatim answer in runtime-artifacts/audit.md.

## Step 3.5 — Context Project Opt-In (ask ONCE here, downstream reuses it)

This is an **input-capture** step, not development work — it does not create requirements, branches, or code. Ask it here so it is asked ONCE for the whole ticket flow; the routed workflow reads the recorded answer instead of re-asking.

1. **Ensure the folder**: ensure `spec/context-project/existing-knowledge/` exists at the workspace ROOT — **check first, create an empty folder only if missing**, never overwrite an existing one, no README (per `planning/workspace-detection.md` Step 4.6).
2. **Skip the question if already answered**: if `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` already contains a `## Context Project` section, reuse it — do NOT re-ask.
3. Otherwise ask ONCE (inline, per `common/question-format-guide.md`):
   ```
    Are there any context-project artifacts I should use for this task?
      (Human-authored knowledge about the CURRENT project — how the existing system works,
       where things live, what each module does — under spec/context-project/, one subfolder per
       module named exactly after it. This is context about what exists, NOT the ticket's requirements.)

   A) Yes — paste the exact path of the file/folder to use (e.g. spec/context-project/existing-knowledge/ALIX.BMS/interview.md)
   B) No  — continue without it

   [Answer]:
   ```
4. Record in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` (only that pasted path is ever read — no auto-scan):
   ```markdown
   ## Context Project
   - **Use Artifacts**: [Yes/No]
   - **Artifact Path**: [exact path pasted — or `—` if No]
   ```
5. Block until answered; log the prompt and verbatim answer in runtime-artifacts/audit.md. On A with a non-existent path, tell the user and re-ask.

## Step 3.5b — Context References Opt-In (ask ONCE here, downstream reuses it)

This is an **input-capture** step for reference materials that guide the NEW work (UX wireframes, design mockups, API specs, research docs, etc.). Ask it here so it is asked ONCE for the whole ticket flow; the routed workflow reads the recorded answer instead of re-asking.

1. **Ensure the folder**: ensure `spec/context-project/new-references/` exists at the workspace ROOT — **check first, create an empty folder only if missing**, never overwrite an existing one, no README.
2. **Skip the question if already answered**: if `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` already contains a `## Context References` section, reuse it — do NOT re-ask.
3. Otherwise ask ONCE (inline, per `common/question-format-guide.md`):
   ```
    Do you have any reference materials I should use for this work?
      (UX wireframes, design mockups, UI/UX specifications, API specs, research docs,
       architecture diagrams, or any other reference documents — placed under spec/context-project/new-references/
       at the workspace root. These guide what to BUILD, not what already exists.)

   A) Yes — paste the exact path(s) of the file(s)/folder(s) to use
      (e.g. spec/context-project/new-references/wireframes/checkout-flow.png, spec/context-project/new-references/api-spec.yaml)
   B) No  — continue without it

   [Answer]:
   ```
4. Record in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` (only those paths are ever read — no auto-scan):
   ```markdown
   ## Context References
   - **Use References**: [Yes/No]
   - **Reference Paths**: [comma-separated exact paths pasted — or `—` if No]
   ```
5. Block until answered; log the prompt and verbatim answer in runtime-artifacts/audit.md. On A with a non-existent path, tell the user and re-ask for that path.
6. **Auto-register UI/UX references as Design References**: any path that is a UI wireframe, mockup, screenshot, or design spec is ALSO registered in `## Design References` per DR-1.

## Step 3.6 — Load the Design Reference Guardrail (NO question — enforcement only)

**Load `common/design-reference-grounding.md` and apply it for the whole ticket flow.**

**Do NOT ask the user anything here.** This step adds no prompt. It is purely reactive enforcement:

- **DR-1** — any file path, folder path, spec document, screenshot, or design URL the user names in ANY input during this ticket flow (the ticket text itself, an answer, a scope adjustment, a remediation comment) is registered in `## Design References` in `runtime-artifacts/aire-state.md` at that moment.
- **DR-2/DR-3/DR-4** — the routed workflow MUST read its **actual content** in the stage where it was named, before generating that stage's artifacts. Confirming a path exists or listing folder names is not reading; a binary format is not a reason to defer.
- **DR-5** — re-consult it automatically before writing code touching a covered component, stating per component either `Design reference: <path> — grounded (...)` or `Design reference: none covers this component`. No gate, no checkpoint.
- **DR-8 / DR-6** — on a mismatch, check the `### Reconciliations` table first: a point already decided against the reference by an earlier stage is **settled — follow the framework artifact and never reintroduce it**. Otherwise follow the reference, state plainly what differed and that you followed it, amend the AC to stay truthful, record the reconciliation, and continue. **Never turn it into a question and never halt.**

If the ticket description itself names such an artifact, register it now and log it in `runtime-artifacts/audit.md`.

## Step 4 — Route to the Existing Workflow

On the user's answer:

- **A (Bug)** → announce ` Routing [TICKET-ID] to the bug workflow.`, read `workflows/bug-fix.md`, and follow it **exactly** from its Step 1, as if the user had typed `bug-fix [TICKET-ID]`. The already-fetched ticket content MAY be reused for its Ticket Capture step (no second fetch needed) — everything else runs as written — at the end of analysis it **breaks once** for the ve handoff (that flow's Step 9: design artifacts committed + pushed, `/ve-implement` instructions shown), then continues into `bug-fix-implement` in the same session on the user's `yes` — no second keyword needed. If the user answers `no`, or the session is interrupted after analysis, `ticket-implement [TICKET-ID]` resumes straight into `bug-fix-implement` via the router's Step 1 resume.
- **B (Enhancement)** → announce ` Routing [TICKET-ID] to the enhancement workflow.`, read `workflows/enhancement-implement.md`, and follow it **exactly** from its Step 1, as if the user had typed `enhancement-implement [TICKET-ID]`. The already-fetched ticket content MAY be reused for its Ticket Capture step. Its own issue-type warning still applies (a Bug-type ticket routed to enhancement → warn and confirm, per that workflow).

Log the routing decision in runtime-artifacts/audit.md. From this point on the target workflow OWNS the session — branch naming, state (`Workflow Type:`), gates, PR type, and archive location all come from it.

## Critical Rules

- 🔴 The router asks ONE question and routes — it never generates requirements, stories, branches, or code itself.
- 🔴 The routing question has EXACTLY two options — `A` and `B`, printed inline in the terminal. NEVER a `C`/"Other"/extra option, never an interactive menu, never a question file (this overrides the question-format-guide for this one question). Only `A` or `B` is a valid answer; anything else → re-ask.
- 🔴 The USER'S answer decides the route — the recommendation from issue type/labels is advisory only.
- 🔴 Load the target workflow file ONLY after the answer (context saving); then follow it EXACTLY — no steps skipped, merged, or reordered.
- 🔴 Resume safety: an existing `Workflow Type: bug|enhancement` for the same ticket routes immediately without re-asking.
- 🔴 Every audit entry carries `**User Email**:`; the routing question and answer are logged verbatim.
